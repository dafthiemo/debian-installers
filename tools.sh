#
#          -e option: Will cause a bash script to exit immediately when a command fails.
#
#          -E option: Traps are pieces of code that fire when a bash script catches certain signals.
#                     Traps can also be used to catch special bash signals like EXIT, DEBUG, RETURN, and ERR.
#                     Using -e without -E will cause an ERR trap to not fire in certain scenarios.
#
# -o pipefail option: The bash shell normally only looks at the exit code of the last command of a pipeline.
#                     This behavior is not ideal as it causes the -e option to only be able to act on
#                     the exit code of a pipelineâ€™s last command.
#                     (foo | echo "a" --> foo will be in error but not echo "a") ==> no error as the last command of | is OK
#                     This is where -o pipefail comes in. This particular option sets the exit code of a pipeline
#                     to that of the rightmost command to exit with a non-zero status, or to zero if all commands
#                     of the pipeline exit successfully.
#
#          -u option: Will causes the bash shell to treat unset variables as an error and exit immediately.
#                     Unset variables are a common cause of bugs in shell scripts, so having unset variables
#                     cause an immediate exit is often highly desirable behavior.
